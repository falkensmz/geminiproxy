   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your fork and branch
   - Fill in the PR template
   - Submit!

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=geminiproxy

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_client.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Use descriptive test function names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Flake8** for linting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **mypy** for type checking

### Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where possible
- Write descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Comment complex logic

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings following Google style
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Include examples for new features

## Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

### Examples
```
Add rate limiting to batch processing
Fix memory leak in cache system
Update documentation for new API endpoints
Refactor database connection handling
```

## Release Process

1. Update version in `setup.py` and `__init__.py`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a release branch
4. Run full test suite
5. Create pull request to main
6. Tag release after merge
7. Build and publish to PyPI
